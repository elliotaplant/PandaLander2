## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to download an app to use Panda Print?

Nope! You [sign up](https://pandaprint.co/signup.html) once on our website then you never have to use the web, an app, or CVS to print photos ever again.

### What size photos do you print?

By default all rectangular photos get printed on 4x6 photo paper, and square photos get printed on 4x4 paper. If you want a different size, just ask and we'll make it happen!

### What if my photo doesn't fit perfectly in a 4x6 aspect ratio?

We'll automatically crop your photo to fit a 4x6. If we have to crop it a lot, we'll send you the cropped version to make sure it's ok before we print.

### What if I want to remove a photo from my order?

No problem! Just send us a message telling us you want to delete a photo and we'll delete it for you.

### Is Panda Print a person or a robot?

It's both! We use software to handle some things and friendly people to handle the more complicated stuff. If you ever get confused, we are always available to answer your questions.

### How good is the quality of your photos?

We use the most advanced wet-lab equipment in the world with silver halide prints on Fujifilm paper to deliver the best print quality possible. If your photos don't look as good as you expected them to, we'll happily refund them and print new ones for you for free.
