## Frequently Asked Questions

### If I haven't built my product yet, why would I start selling it?
Think of VeriFire as your first sales pitch to real customers. If you don't get traction, you can save time and money by iterating early. If you do get traction, then you have a list of customers ready to buy your product when you finish. It's a win-win.

### Will my customers by confused if they sign up on my site but I don't have a product?
Possibly, but there are several ways to reward them for being an early bird. At the very least, we suggest offering them a discount when the product is ready. Another great strategy is to invite them to provide feedback as you build your product, because people love when companies listen to them and you get the benefit of real customer opinions.

### How is VeriFire different from crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter?
We love Kickstarter, but in order to successfully fund your idea you often need to have a finalized idea of your product and pricing. With VeriFire, you can test out different features, marketing strategies, and price points before you even start prototyping. Consider running a VeriFire campaign to make sure you're ready for Kickstarter!

### Do I need engineering or design experience to build my page?
We made our site templates as simple as possible so you only need to think about the business side of things. All you need to provide are the images and copy. Alternatively, we can build your page for you with the Pro plan.

### How do get people to visit my VeriFire page?
You can buy Google or Facebook Ads, send a link out to a mailing list, buy space in your local newspaper, or invite people on the street. Different businesses have different ways of attracting customers, so we support all different acquisition methods. If you would like us to handle the advertising for you, we offer that in the Pro plan.

### What if I don't get any signups on VeriFire?
It's time to start iterating! Although it's a bummer not to get sales, at least you found out your idea needs work before you poured time, money, and passion into it.

### What if I get too many signups on VeriFire?
You get to start building your business with the confidence that the market is demanding your product. You can always end your VeriFire campaign early to start building.
